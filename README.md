"# DataMining"
These are projects from CS484--Data Mining course. Creaated by Xiaowen Fang

Amazon_Review:

This project does a polarized sentiment analysis on product reviews on amazon.
I use word2vec to transfer text reviews to word vectors. And use PCA
to do demension reduction. Then use KNN on testing set.

Medical_Molecule:

This project predicts weather a created molecule works for a certain kind of drug.
Each sample is a sparse (100,000 features) feature vector representing a molecule.
800 samples in total.
I use SVM for this one.
