Amazon_Review:

This project does a polarized sentiment analysis on product reviews on amazon. I
use word2vec to transfer text reviews to word vectors. And use PCA to do
dimension reduction. Then use KNN on testing set.

Medical_Molecule:

This project predicts weather a created molecule works for a certain kind of
drug. Each sample is a sparse (100,000 features) feature vector representing a
molecule. 800 samples in total. I use SVM for this one.

News_clustering:

This project aims to cluster news to different topics. I use hieratical
clustering with ward measurement metric.

Rating_movies:

This project predicts the ratings of each movie rated by users. I use matrix
factorization (SVD).  This is about recommender system. Dataset is from
MovieLens.
