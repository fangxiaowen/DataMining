knn_amazon.py:

knn_amazon.py is doing a polarized sentiment analysis on product reviews on amazon.
I use word2vec to transfer text reviews to word vectors. And use PCA
to do demension reduction. Then use KNN on testing set.

drug.py:

drug.py is predicting weather a created molecule works for a certain kind of medicine.
I use SVM for this one.
